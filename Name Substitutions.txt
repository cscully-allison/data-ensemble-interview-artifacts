In P5 and P7 and P8, we mention [Programmatic Performance Analysis Software A] and [Programmatic Performance Analysis Software B]. What are these?

In P6, we mention [Scientific Simulation Software A] and [Scientific Simulation Software B]. What are these? 

What is Per Flow / Perfetto in P7?

In P10, what is [Performance Vis Tool]?

## Ideas

- Scripting-integrated approaches assume people have familiarity with the structure of their data
- Wrangling assumes people have familiar with the structure of their data
- This shows that people can forget entire aspects of their data to explore
- During elicitation of tasks/requirements/needs, people may forget parts of that data which then never make it into the custom visualization solution at all.

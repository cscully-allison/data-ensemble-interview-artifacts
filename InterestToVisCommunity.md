## Ideas

- Scripting-integrated approaches assume people have familiarity with the structure of their data
- Wrangling assumes people have familiar with the structure of their data
- This shows that people can forget entire aspects of their data to explore
- During elicitation of tasks/requirements/needs/data abstraction, people may forget parts of that data which then never make it into the custom visualization solution at all. 
- People have trouble thinking in multiple dimensions and understanding what is getting aggregated, even in 'simple aggregations' as opposed to dim. reduction
- Tie to "Data Recon" somehow maybe?

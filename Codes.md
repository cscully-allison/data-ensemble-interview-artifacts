Conventions
===========

During early stages, please add recklessly. Possible dupes are okay. We will
split/merge in later rounds through discussion/affinity diagramming etc.

## Themes are written as first-level headers
  - Codes are written as next level, subcodes as the following level
  - Evidence is listed as bullet points, ideally quotes but at least
    references to participants.

Themes & Codes
==============

## Ensemble Elephants

These codes have something to do with the mental model of the data. This
probably needs to be split or at least made hierarchical at some point, but
for now let's put everything here.

### Pieces of the EnsembleAPI were forgotten.
  - For each participant and each EnsembleAPI piece, list when, if ever, the
    participant alluded to the piece and how. 
  - For this code, there are four pieces: Performance Data, Metadata, Stats
    Data, and Call Tree.
  - For this code, there are four places it can appear: initial verbal
    question, drawing, tasks, and never. It may be useful to mark when
something appeared in one but was later forgotten.


### Participants dropped or reduced dimensions of the data.



### Influences on model

  #### Data model is tool-dependent

  #### Data sourcing is part of the model

  #### Data's relation to the domain is part of the model

  #### Data is described based on how it is stored

  #### Data is described based on how it is accessed

  #### Data is described based on how it is used




## Metadata

These codes have something to do with metadata.

### What is Metadata?

		
### Metadata is hazy.


### Metadata is not data.



## Drawing

  ### Scale is implied

  ### Dimensions are added by stacking.

  ### Dimensions are added by overplotting.

  ### Dimensions are added by duplciation.




## Uncategorized as-of-yet observations

  ### Balanced node-link diagrams are trees, accept no substitutions

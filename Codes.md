Themes & Codes
==============

## Ensemble Elephants

These codes have something to do with the mental model of the data. This
probably needs to be split or at least made hierarchical at some point, but
for now let's put everything here.


### What is an ensemble?
  - Multiple profiles 
    - P1: "Purposely multiple profiles of data as in comparison to [DatasetAPI], where it may be only or usually is only one profile?"


### Pieces of the EnsembleAPI were forgotten.
  - For each participant and each EnsembleAPI piece, list when, if ever, the
    participant alluded to the piece and how. 
  - For this code, there are four pieces: Performance Data, Metadata, Stats
    Data, and Call Tree.
  - For this code, there are four places it can appear: initial verbal
    question, drawing, tasks, and never. It may be useful to mark when
something appeared in one but was later forgotten.
  - P1
    - Performance data: 
      - Spoken
      - Drawn as a table
    - Call tree: 
      - Spoken* - acknowledges DatasetAPI nodes, but claims EnsembleAPI is different. Nodes appear to be used in a different way than as a tree
      - Not Drawn
      - Would consider this not totally included
    - Metadata
      - Only implied through indices when spoken/drawn
      - Alluded to during tasks
    - Stats
      - Never


### Influences on importance

  #### Presence

    - P1: "throughout all the different kinds of data that I work with, there's always nodes"
    - P1: "the metrics themselves is another dimension of that, that I'm adjacent to the nodes that I'm expecting to see when I'm working with the data"

  #### Indexing power

    - P1: "but it's kind of less important because we have that represented as like an inner index . So it's kind of like, subsequent to the nodes, I guess, in the visualization in my head."

  #### What participant interacts wtih

    - P1: "Yeah, I order it because that's kind of like the when I'm developing the significance of what what I'm interacting with the most, it's probably in that order."


### Participants dropped or reduced dimensions of the data.



### Influences on model

  #### Data model is tool-dependent

   - P1: "Does it matter in the way I think about it, because I think about it in a [EnsembleAPI] way versus like, a [MeasurementAPI] way or like, it's, I get to choose in what way I want to look at it."

  #### Data sourcing is part of the model

   - P1: "[PhysicsCode]'s like one example or like some [BenchmarkSuite] run where you have like time as a column, maybe exclusive time, inclusive time."

  #### Data's relation to the domain is part of the model

  #### Data is described based on how it is stored

  #### Data is described based on how it is accessed

   - P1: "Yeah, so I'm just doing a performance data table, kind of because that's the way I think about when I read in a data set, and I'm working with a data set."

  #### Data is described based on how it is used

  #### Exact data is not important

    - P1: "so the data I work with, it's sort of arbitrary as a developer"
    - P1: "the columns themselves are kind of arbitrary"
    - P1: "And then third, probably the profiles. That's the data itself, but it's kind of less important because we have that represented as like an inner index. So it's kind of like, subsequent to the nodes, I guess, in the visualization in my head. So that's where I kind of like, put things even though thinking about is kind of counterintuitive, because without the profiles, you wouldn't have any data."




## Metadata

These codes have something to do with metadata.

### What is Metadata?

		
### Metadata is hazy.


### Metadata is not data.


### Profiles are the real data.

  - P1: "And then third, probably the profiles. That's the data itself"
  - P1: "without the profiles, you wouldn't have any data."



## Drawing

  ### Scale is implied

  ### Indicators of scale

  #### Uses ellipses to indicate more rows

    - P1

  #### Uses etc to indicate more columns

    - P1


  ### Dimensions are added by stacking.

  ### Dimensions are added by overplotting.

  ### Dimensions are added by duplciation.




## Uncategorized as-of-yet observations

  ### Balanced node-link diagrams are trees, accept no substitutions

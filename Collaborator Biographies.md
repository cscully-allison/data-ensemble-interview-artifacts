### P1
	P1 is a Master's student advised by P6 at his university (U1). Their role in the thicket project is development focused. They are the developer in charge of reading in and formatting performance data so that it can be loaded into the relevant parts of the Thicket object. They also develop most the functionality related to the core "Performance Data" dataframe including specifying functions for combining performance data with relevant metadata.
	
### P2
	P2 is a Masters student advised by PI 1 (Primary Investigator 1) at an east coast state university (U2). They are primarily a developer on the Thicket project. His focus is on statistical aggregation and data stored in the "Statistics Data" dataframe. As part of this work he develops interfaces for common statistical aggregrations which users may want to perform. He has also done some work developing wrappers to seaborn visualizations which summarize statistics data. 
	
### P3
	P3 is a Masters student advised by PI 1 at U2. They are a developer on the Thicket project and generates documentation for Thicket in the form of interactive Jupyter notebooks. Their main development work is focused on the "Metadata" dataframe. Related to the metadata portion of this data structure, P3 develops interfaces allowing users to filter profiles and the associated call graph based on metadata values. 

### P4
```
P4 is research professor at U2 working with PI 1. Their role in the Thicket project has been advising and aiding P2, P3, P5 and P7 with implementation details. 
```

### P5 
```
P5 is a PhD student at U2. They are a first year PhD student and thier primary role on the Thicket project has been developing analysis workflows and integrating off the shelf visualization packages into Thicket, notably PyGWalker (a notebook embedded Tableau clone) and seaborn/matplotlib.
```

### P6
```
P6 is a Computer Scientist at the National Lab associated with the Thicket project and a Professor at U1. They are the PI of the Thicket project. Their involvement in the project is entirely management focused, driving the design and development directions of this software. They also are partially responsible for finding and communicating with potential users. 
```

### P7
```
P7 is a PhD student working at U2 with PI1's research group. Their role in Thicket is limited. They maintain and develop Thicket's query language functionality; however thier pimary project is with a different team at the National Lab. As a senior PhD student in PI1's lab, they assist and advise P2, P3 and P5 with development at an advisory level from time to time. They also sit in on the bi-weekly Thicket-specific meetings between National Lab and U2.
```

### P8
```
P8 is a physics PhD student at U1 using a physics simulation software package developed at National Lab for thier research. They are the first user of Thicket for a real experiment.
```

### P9
```
P9 is a Computer Scientist at National Lab. They are the co-PI/lead developer of the Thicket project. They manage the high level design and the day-to-day details of Thicket's implementation by the main programmers (P1,P2,P3,P5,P7 and myself) in coordination with P6. They also do some implementation as needed.
```

### P10
```
P10 is a Computer Scientist at National Lab. They are not directly involved in the Thicket project, but instead develop a performance measurement software library that outputs data which Thicket supports. They sit in on most weekly meetings,  advise Thicket developers on thier data model as needed, as well modify their software to fit the data needs of Thicket and Thicket users.

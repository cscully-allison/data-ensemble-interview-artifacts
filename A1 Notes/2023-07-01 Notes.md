[BenchmarkSuite]
- [BenchmarkSuite] is not a call tree
	- More of a logical grouping of
- P1 - P3 fundamentally do not understand the data
- **The dangers of using the one dataset**
- [BenchmarkSuite] is a weird one off to the [EnsembleAPI] project
	- They forced [BenchmarkSuite] into it

	- Later look at codes in this and compare with codes in Williams et. al.
		- Walny's data sketching one
		- Yagoda et al
- Comes in with a defined structure
	- Everyone we interviewed is author on a paper with a diagram on the dataset and yet there is signficant divergence on the model
		- People are only seeing the tail of the elephant because that's what they code
		- How do you do an exploratory analysis with an API?
			- Educational work this?
- We need more help to tell people what the structure of their data is at all times?
	- "Forgotten dimensions"
	- Given the limitations . . . 
		- Metadata is the independent variable
	- There is a hierarchy of this dataset
		- That is swept into metadata
		- Discuss metadata as M's thing
			- As a limitation
			- But we observed it from others

## [A5] on Relationship to df.head()

Init Codes
- Friday getting back to the code file
- Feeling the limitations of the transcripts
	- Transcripts give us quotes and new things 
- P8 not putting the metadata in the model
	- Metadata as a big 
	- **Metadata as a note to himself**
	- **Make a memo of this**
- Make a ton of indented lists
- Balanced node link diagrams are trees accept no substitutions
	- D and O both agreed on a tree-tree
- Is this a tree?
	- Node link diagram
	- Balanced Node link diagram orientation meaningful 
	- M on trees
- Going back through
	- How much it adheres to the figure in the paper?
	- P9 does not know too much about the paper
- File of Codes
	- It started with
	- I can adjust the codes
	- Starting in the exact opposite of K2's data
	- The data does not appear until the task
	- It's worrisome that we could only lead them to the data by asking enough questions
		- A "The data abstraction is an intervention"
	- [A5] is starting to see where people drop dimensions and catch themselves
- Related Works for sure and the rest of the paper
	- 3 weeks 
	- Presentation date for HCC
- Not all codes need quotes
	- P3 - Brief explination
	- "Transcript beginning with blah"

	- Coding [A5]'s own notes
- Scale of analysis
	- Ensemble
	- For others an ensemble means lots of IV dimensions
		- P9 of ensemble of dimensions
- Statement of Positionality
	- We are familiar to the domain as well

	- D's "reminders to myself"

Friday meeting
- How do we find out what's important for you?
- DS.scaling_study
	- Use natural language processing to find the correct variables
	- Why is this not in cube
	- Draw me the 4x3 charts for multiple scaling studies
- How much EDA is us making up for us collecting the data
	- But also the depth we have to consider
- Send out invites
	- On other paper

Paper Framing
- A difficult dataset and an API?
	- Still about a more complicated dataset
	- Treats to validity:
		- We cannot generalize too much
	- Tie the work back to the validity
- There wasn't one thesis to grasp in Sarahs Paper
- Or Ensemble Framing?
- What is our Thesis here.
	- The metadata theme is still interesting on its own
	- Daria Paper
		- Who's taking care
	- 2 - 3 Major Findings is fine
		- Paper is still viable
	- An investigation into the API interface of thicket and why is that
	- Here's how people deal with a complicated structure
	- Mostly used similar things however they had similar differences
	- Could have been most agressive
- Central theme of this paper
	- This is what people do when given a complicated data structure that they work with
	- Not all data is going to fit nicely into a single dataframe
	- And not into a relationtional database 
	- [EnsembleAPI] object ensemble
	- Some parts are inheriently fuzzy
	- Is that a problem with how people are thinking about it
	- Stats table can be reduced
		- We didn't view that as part of the data 
	- **This is how people deal with a complicated data structure and here's where the difficulties lie**
		- People need a way to keep better track of this^
		- One of the difficulties is that there is a proliferation of objects
	- **People are dropping dimensions and compressing things without be conscious of it!**
	- What is hard codes!
- Related Work
	- Ensemble Data is Especially Hard
		- Explain why we took that as our initial questions
		- **Multi-Run Analysis**
		- These are terms used but we went with the teams analysis
		- Put ***ensembles*** in the abstract
	- How are people supposed to do scrip based Data Science and what
		- Data science
		- Background research into data models of Data Science
		- Cast this as a data science and not HPC thing! 
	- K2 Stuff
- How do people describe big amorphous datasets
	- Describe it as table columns and 
- **Metadata**
	- We talk about how metadata just exists
	- Profiles are the data
	- If metadata is not the right term then there are relations in the data that neither model captures
- How data is used is part of the model
- Database Terminology
	- Uncategorized
- Merge K2's Codes by Hand
- Why we started with ensembles
	- CITE Ensembles and Metadata Slides from Scalable Tools Workshop 
	- While [EnsembleAPI] is a well defined structure
- Methods and Codes
	- Refining related works will be important

What do we do to keep this is the VIS track
- Codes for keeping visualizations in the process
- Throw in [A5]'s slide from the [LAB] talk
- People were just drawing the plots

Worried about the lack of structure to the metadata

**CITE THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON SHOWING INTERSTING PLOTS**

Demystifying metadata data and wether or not its metadata.

We think that research in this direction is encouraging and this work supports research.

What we are doing
- We need some better way to communicate where they sit in the process
- Alluded to -> became concrete
- We can't have too much of a diversity
- Each dataset had under 10 participants per dataset
- Tamara had a paper on how journalists reason about data
	- Inductive and Deductive citations
- The tasks were more interesting as an elicitation 
- We did not ask what the most important part was


Merge [A5]'s and K2's codes

Linking meaningfully
- Move measured data/metrics/dependant variables is most important into the other importance bit


Influences on the model == valudating and ties in with K2 work

Level of granularity
- What tables and axes
	- What facets are we capturing
- What columns in particular are people using

We don't need to put all the themes in the draft. . .
- Just put the more mature ones in

THINK ABOUT HOW TO CATEGORIZE PEOPLE

There is an implementation error
Think about the datatypes of metadata line 727
How much metadata is a general problem
Deciding that profile data is the real data and giving people access to the metadata

Defintion of metadata helps us
- Profile table vs Metadata Table
- [EnsembleAPI] is not word of god and is an artifact of these problems

Drawings 
- Drawing

Summarize tasks, where people were able to succeed with them and where they failed
- Note how it elicited problems with data model

The strong scaling and architecture study
	- I want small multiple plots 
	- Maybe some more. . . they are really struggling here
	- What is the correct answer?
	- We should make a code

Positionality
- We are working with experienced data scientists here
- Why its hard to map the data design go into problems with ensembles

Why does anyone care (esp the CHI community)

Too go big or go home
- Might just require more explanation
- Details first to overview
- Don't know if that should be in the introduction

Go back to the original why did we care
- We observed that people were struggling with this dataset
- People would ask for visualizations that didn't make sense

Instead of summarizing the data itself
- Rather than summarizing the data we need to summarize the data set structure itself
- ^This is my point

*What is an overview of complex heterogenous data? And what are the implications of the tools we build and what are the expectations we have on the data scientists who build this.*

Don't directly quote the mantra!

Why do we care that its hard to do overviews:
- We need to better understand the struggles people have with these datasets so that we can better provide information on how to build these tools

*We have to be plain: we looked at one group, we are all working with the same structure
- *We believe that this problem is generalizable beyond this because of A's work

Go back and do more people. . .
- Next group to annex is everyone who does multi-run studies

Do we want to make this about mental models or something else?
- Do we want to talk about mental models
- Conceptions

CHI style quote title
"cute quote": struggles conceptualizing multidimensional datasets during exploratory data analysis 
- representations (or other vis like type word)

Massaging the analysis

Rigor
- 2 - 3 people coding it

Large datasets are hard to work with is an accessible thought :)
	- The intro needs to be more accessibly
	- Limitations is too early

Turn our limitations into a positionality statement
- Influences how we analyzed the data

Methodology and findings
- Redundancy in findings
- Study participants before study design
- Research questions in the intro

Analysis
- We were looking at the themes

We can put the RQs in the introduction
- Having them in the intro would be helpful to see what is in our papers

Findings organizations
- Organizing according to RQ's

Having a more verbose definition of our
Again positionality statement
- Make it clear that the HPC people are Data Scientists

Findings were confusing
- Showing diagrams could be useful

Related works was soon

Q6 - Was asked conditionally
- Conditional on whether they mention it alread

Fix the visualizations
- Put them in an order that makes sense

Regarding the interviews
- Did we follow up inbetween
- Say semi-setructured interviews

Like to know what is important about these drawings.
- Expand the figure captions 

Hint at the discussion part to the introduction of the paper

Circling around some ideas that are part of the bigger picture
- A particular case study
- Then of course I'm trying to frame it as a bigger thing
- What we are trying to do; how to we get to the big picture
- We care about both the specific case and the big picture

[A5]
- What she has been thinking about this
- We are under threat of bias
	- We are stilling a lot of these same struggles
	- This compliments K2's study
- People should have come to the same conclusion, that they would know the dataset really well, should have come to the data structure they were familiar with

 
J
- Nicheness
- **What do we as designers have to deal with for people to pick it up!
- **We had this expectation that they would be able to do this and then they kept it all in their minds**
- **Setup this whole story up front**
- **Just be frank about what our expectations were and how they were violated
- We thought this would be supported by the literature
- Nicheness
	- We didn't have people outside of this
	- We studied data scientists, just so happened that they were in this context
	- But its based on literature that we looked at from 
	- Argue explicitly how this population relates back to the broader data science population


See how deeply how the research questions relate to the related work
- It's ok to construct the story after the fact
- Use the related work 1 by 1
- In findings address the research questions directly

In the discussion:
- Directly address the research questions\

What is the top level organization
- Either themes and or RQ but both are deeply represented

Change title of section 5 to Themes
- Tells us what the interesting point is
- Choose sentences with verbs!

Related works relate them to the background
Is there a relation between the background and how they relate to multiple related works.

Research Questions
- Where sooner should they be
- In the the related works
	- Be strongly motivated by the literature
- At the end of the introduction
- There wasn't much of a connection
- Think about how they connect to the motivation and the big story
- Bringing up the particular situation this early 
- ?? Particular to General or General to Particular ??

We can cite K2's work
- Can we tell the story without going into the domain at all in the introduction
- We have data scientists
	- Emphasize this extremely complex dataset is because of HPC

Where background belongs and how detailed it needs to be
- The details of the dataset do not really matter
- We expected that these experts would be able to do it fine
- Only talk about the system to make our points

The system is the artifact that people were using
- Here is the structure we thought we would get

These people are experts and the fact they struggled with it is an interface problem and not a them problem!

How can we build an introduction and drive into related works

Lets throw in the description of the research in the INTRO

CHI Paper
- K2's does not paper backs up our expectations
- Unlike other work where users are familiar with tree paper
- How can we do this with the absolute minimum of domain knowledge needed
	- What is the story we can tell to people who know absolutely nothing about computing

Try to get the narrative in the much shorter abstract
- Key findings

Separate discussion from findings
- One whole page just answering research questions
- Write out the page answering the research questions
- Go long
	- With the findings first
- Discussion
	- Answering the research questions
	- Suggestions for what we can possibly do
		- The community
		- Design guidance

K2's figure could be less granular
- But still works
- Too much decoding

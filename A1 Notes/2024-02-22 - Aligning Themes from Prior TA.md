In our last round of coding we extracted many themes and codes but I feel like the thematic organization started to fall apart due to a lack of structure in our analysis. There are so many good and interesting ideas represented in our codes.md document however they feel like blobs of ideas to me and very broad.

The deductive codes are very good from that first round but the inductive codes needed some work. I would like to get these codes to fit into the structure of themes which were developed in the second round of analysis. Here I will attempt to extract the most interesting themes from this part.

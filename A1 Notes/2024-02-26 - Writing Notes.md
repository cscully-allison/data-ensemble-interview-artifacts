Ok we have broken up our overview of heterogenous datasets into two locations. One, in background to provide context on what our definition of HD is. This will provide context to our constant use of the term and place bounds on what we are discussing, since the term itself is at least partially ambigious.

In related work, we need to emphasize that our domain is not the only place where these datasets exist. (Although I should cite some examples of it in this domain -- caliper, hpctoolkit, TAU?) We have a bundle of disperate citations related to smaller domains but tied together for being "big data." We need to expand our description of each of these individual sources to like a sentence each.

I want to make the argument that scientific ensembles are commonly heterogenous but I am having a hard time finding proof of that. Surely in the weather space they have a matrix of  geospatial data, but I suppose that geospatial data can still just be a matrix with coordinates per row kind of thing. Then it's just a table -_-

%OH IS THIS PART OF THE STORY IS THIS A FAILURE OF DATA ABSTRACTIONS 0_0? WE HAD A DATA ABSTRACTION AND IT DIDN'T HELP US TRULY UNDERSTAND THE DATA!! IT CAUSED PROBLEMS %

But this is more of a indictment of the choices which were made to build this abstraction. Or, that the abstraction is not especially helpful to users. Which is not very interesting, but. . . this was the developers who made the abstraction! And users interface with the abstraction. . .

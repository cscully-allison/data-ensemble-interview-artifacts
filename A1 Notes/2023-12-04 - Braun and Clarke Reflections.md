## Chapter 3 - Coding

Codes should be kept atomic

How do we avoid thinking about themes during the coding process when the themes are what ties the data back to the research questions we are examining? We do need the research questions to know that we are coding the right content. I suppose the workflow can be. . . "does this chunk of  text refer broadly to my research Q?" And then I ignore the q after that. 

Coding is about capturing repetitions and differentiations in meaning. I suppose we have to differentiate first to find patterns.

I wonder if this approach may be a valid way for me to screw my head right about what I am doing in the moment

2 Hour Coding Session Plan:

1. Assess the value of a block of text(s) and insert
	1. Using research questions to validate
2. Code without regard to broader ideas or research question
	1. I don't think holding the context is needed because I verified the relevance in step 1 and the words contain the context
	2. Watch out for missing out on more interpretive and conceptual observations
3. Reflect and refine codes from this session

Codes are a translation of the text into manageable sized chunks and may naturally be merged when redundancies appear

How do we keep codes from being summaries of the text/ how do we elevate our insights on the fly? 

"The best coding is the coding that fits your purpose in analysing your data"

Sematic Coding are codes that describe the surface level meaning of the text. Latent coding describes an abstract or conceptual level of meaning in the text.

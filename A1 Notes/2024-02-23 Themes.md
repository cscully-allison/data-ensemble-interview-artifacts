Why we did not include codes
	- Not everything fits and I don't want to force it to fit

More context matters, context is important - theme?

They are thinking in the visualizations of the data rather than about the data. . . 
- Thinking in terms of the output of the analysis rather than the data to get there\

Up to three words

HD -> Isin't

Metadata needs some pithy sentence to describe it

Findings are presentation of the themes and the discussion is the research questions and others

We can interpret in the themes; that is a strength of the research

Working with LHDs is complicated . . . or heterogenous data. . .

Metadata is it's own thing. . .

Even if the things we are describing are distilled and then

Deductive section and inductive section
- We can back reference 
- Do our best towards the organization 

Choose the quotes to set up in the findings . . . and maybe support
Metadata being very task driven
- Tie into the deductive codes

Is metadata all in one bucket because the data is so hard to collect and so large.
- Is there something for this through line the relates the result being about performance data with the raw data while ignoring all the transformations inbetween

O is automatically aggregating/ignoring dimensions
- And one other instance

Our positionality is very important
- The definition of the people we work with not as data science experts but rather as the more typical data science users

Background section just needs to have what the data is not what the data means
- High level description of what the data means, high level with lots of examples

Among the 10 people this many things were mentioned as "metadata"
"METADATA BECOMES THE CATCH ALL"
- Scalable tools suggests that this is at the level of the domain
- At some point we need to draw on our own expertise, and the metadata is not always recorded
- Focus on the fuzzy concept of metadata

Dimensions that are forgotten

Our story is that we were trying to design a vis and they gave us visualizations that don't make sense

Subsection in background
- All the places this interfaces with visualization

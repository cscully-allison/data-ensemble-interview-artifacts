Thematic analysis is done I think. There will be things which we will cut and expand on, but there does need to be writing done on this. I think we need to divide the analysis into deductive and inductive. 

This will also change the discussion of the research questions.

But organizationally I think the paper should follow this format:

1. We started with research questions. Here they are
2. Here are the answers we uncovered to those research questions
3. We also found these other interesting things

Separating between inductive and deductive themes is the best way that I can think of organizing this. A figure will absolutely be necessary.

Actually, the themes are not deductive or inductive necessarily. I mean if they are produced from one type of coding then they can maybe be said to be one or the other, but perhaps it just isn't worth making a distinction. I feel like there are so many themes though @\_@

How do I simplify without losing meaningful and interesting insights? *Le sigh* Obviously we will have to cut some of the themes and whatnot but I'm feeling overwhelmed with the scope of what we can write about. IDK. And in the end I do always wonder if we will get to anything meaningful in the end.

I think its far more important now to get everything down and then re-arrange and change reporting practices.

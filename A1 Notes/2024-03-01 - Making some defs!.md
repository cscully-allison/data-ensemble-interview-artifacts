- Mental Data   Models : An internal mental representation of "data" that abstracts the particular details of the "real" and "concrete" external manifestations of said data (e.g. numbers) into a representation which is meaningful to the model holder and is not intentionally constructed. The nature of that meaning is subjective and exists on a spectrum from structural to semantic.  
	- The meaning of a dataset with no context may be entirely structural:
		- 1, 2, 5, 3, 6 < My mental model of this data is "a list of numbers." This is an entirely structural meaning to me. I think this is common in CS TBH. We asked to do MM for an assignment we are agnostic about the meaning of the data, however we have a model of the data we are working with as matrices of NxM
	- If we are aware of what the data represents we can incorporate that into our model. If I am told these are grades, my mental model of this data is now infused with semantic details underpinning it. Each number may be an assignment or a student. I may want to ask why are they so low.
	- There is wiggle room for an individual to incorporate unspoken semantics into their model. If I have the numbers: 30, 99, 94, 75, 81, I may come to believe that these numbers have meaning and incorporate my best guess for that meaning into my model. 

- Abstract Data Model --> Ensemble API Schema : This is an external representation of data that abstracts the particular details of the "real" and "concrete" manifestations of said data (e.g. numbers) into a representation which conveys an intentionally constructed meaning. The nature of that meaning is shared by one or more individuals and exists on a spectrum from structural to semantic.  

- Data Abstractions : The word data abstraction may be too broad. . . 

- Data Abstraction Taxonomies : 

"Type of data  is a  structural or semantic representation of the underlying meaning of that data"

Munzner - Data abstraction:
- Translate from domain-specific language to generic visualization language
- Data Model is just a mathematical abstraction
- Conceptual model is just semantics
	- I would argue this is untrue given the way that CS students and our participants can mostly have a structural understanding of the data with little focus on what it actually means. They know it's performance data but that's not especially relevant to them, the only tasks they are doing with that data is computing it. Working with it as merely mathematical abstraction

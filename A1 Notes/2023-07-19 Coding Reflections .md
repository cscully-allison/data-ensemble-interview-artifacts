Coding went well today. I think I got a slightly better idea of some higher level codes to use for P1 - P3. They are probably similar to the original codes I made but likely less abundant and more general. I am trying to pick out whole lines/sentences or concepts which we can cite in the paper when coding.

By the end of the day however, it gets very difficult to do meaningful coding of these docs. I struggle to identify if I should code references to parts of the \[Ensemble API] object as parts of the data or not. Implicitly they are but it muddies the explicit declarations of what is a part of the data and what is not. They are implicitly parts of the data, however I worry that I am trying to force a narrative structure in my coding.

I am now entering the more unstructured/differently structured responses. I have my concerns that coding may be harder as descriptions get more or less granular than the Ensemble API object's model. P5 right now has significant variance between their description of the data and the way they draw the data. How do I capture that variance in codes?

My coding anxiety is getting the better of me today; but I know I can pull through. I need to feel confident that my codes aren't wrong; they just may be different and perhaps less insightful than [A5]'s and K2's. They have been doing this research longer than I have though so it's understandable.

Today I hope to gain insight into some broader patterns of thought and maybe glean early categorizations of individuals; if such a thing is truly possible with this...

From [A5]:
Casting into an abstraction/drawing an abstraction is what let's the participant indicate the 'and so on' of the data. It's a strategy that allows communicating a much larger dataset.

Oh another possible emergent research question of interest to K2 might be the difference between how they speak about the data and then how they draw it. What gets remembered in one versus the other. Of course, we are influenced by question order so it could just be that they do more when they draw because that's the second we've asked so they've had more time to recall.

I wonder if there's also an argument to be made about asking people in any design study what their data is and then to show on the paper how the data gets to the end point, because that's the question that actually led to the reveal of the metadata organization. I guess in other projects though it's somewhat implicit because rather than data storage they talk about data and thus you implicitly know fields exist, just not how they're organized

Among the 5 individuals coded there are some patterns emerging. P1-P3 have a very dogmatic view of the data that matches the \[EnsembleAPI\] model and they generally break up the parts of the data into the data frames represented in \[EnsembleAPI\]. More specific to the coding \<table metaphor> was a common conception of how the data is stored and constructed for these participants.

As we move over to P4 and P5 we see more divergence in what constitutes a "part of the data." For P4 especially the data is conceived in temporally wide terms from annotation to collection to analysis and includes data at wildly different levels of granularity and focus. His background as an IO perf person seems to impact this model but also he's very careful and subtle in his declarations of what might be relevant to the questions. And, although P4 did not refer to Metadata by name, he provided significant insight into categories of metadata and stressed their importance to the overall dataset continuously by calling them "parameters" and "context". Would it be helpful for P1-P3 to have this view on the data or a hinderance. We are running into some small interface problems that are being resolved as developers get closer to (interact more frequently with) potential users.

P5's terseness in his verbal description of the data I think might be telling of their model. They think about a core of useful data and other aspects are supplemental to that.

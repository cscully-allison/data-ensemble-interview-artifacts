Research statement
- How do I think about things long term
- What if I had 6 years and ramp-up funding what do I do with that

Metadata and dimensionality issue
- The parts I care about do exist
- Think about this in terms of the struggles they face
- This is related to their overall conception of it
- As long as I am careful not to generalize too much in this part
- If you are doing a qualitative study you cannot generalize to the extent that you do in a quantitative study

Don't need to give equal time to all subcategories
- I want to acknowledge this is here but don't want to go into too much detail
- Sometimes they do aggregation without realizing

We are reporting on the fact that we do have a design problem

Visualization and tools part
- A desire for the tools to do something makes sense in the context 
- 1st introduce -> Some of the problems came out when recommending changes to the visualization
- Does the tool provide structure to discuss this
- 2nd backrefrence 

Scenario Studies -> [EnsembleAPI] can be used as a probe to understand where the problems lie
Not trying to defend or improve thicket

It's ok to have sub-sub categories which don't have a ton of quotes under them
Some of these deep under the themes will be ok
- Sometimes its fine when you don't have a ton of support for something 

Data mental model
- Describe the terms 
- Latent data abstractions 


Data abstractions
- We have generalized this in the research
- We note that this has occured and say we went with the other term which is more clear

I also has a structured view of it
- This is influenced by how you use it
- But there can also be other reasons related to a person

J
- Has strong beliefs and a refusal to be specific

We are trying to define something which got subsumed under under latent data abstraction

Be careful with how we word the findings and how we are specifying our use this term

These people are symbolic of people who do data work. 

We are able to see things because of this particular structure
- K2: LCD unstructured
- Us: High structure and specific
- A: Fully unstructured

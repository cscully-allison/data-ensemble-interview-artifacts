Several big categories are emerging quite clearly from the codes. Within and between these categories we should be able to derive some themes. I don't want to subcategorize overmuch on account of the fact that this is the path to grounded theory. Themes should be more descriptive, and this will be what we should be focusing on as quickly as possible.

The categories that are emerging can be very interesting from an analysis standpoint. I'm especially interested in the data analysis category and the data collection category. I strongly suspect that Performance Analysts and engineers represent a class of special relationships with their data generation compared to some other data science fields (esp. machine learning). And perhaps this can tell us something about data governance.

For scientists the relationship between analysis and data collection can vary significantly. If working in highly observational fields like meteorology, data collection and analysis are highly uncoupled. In more experimental fields this is not the case a these scientists run ensembles of simulations and evaluate them in the context of the runtime conditions and parameters of these simulations.

We will probably want to classify performance analysis as a primarily experimental field. This can inform how we relate it to other fields which perform ensemble analysis.

Of the larger categories I have established its clear that LHDs is significantly overloaded, as well as analysis. There are many different ideas contained in each of these categories which need to be explored. Also there is likely some room for merging codes. Tomorrow I will work on sorting through these overloaded categories and perhaps breaking into some subcategories. But then after that, it's all themes.

Some categories may be downright useless for the paper and reporting, but we will see. :/ I hope not too much of it is useless. Remember that you can emphasize things from your own perspective and bias as well. That's totally fine. :)

Breaking out databases and tables into it's own category makes sense for me at this stage.

Ok everything is roughly coded now and they need to be organized into big themes but there are a lot of interesting insights here worth investigating in detail. From the notes I took last Friday and the codes I have come up with today we are starting to coalesce around several big thrusts of interest. Arranged in no particular order:
1.  Metadata - There is a tension between the utility of metadata, both implied and expressed by participants and the general idea that it's not necessary to the analysis/not what we are analyzing. An additional idea of interest is the haziness of metadata. In some instances its a grab bag of whatever a analyst may want to investigate; data post-it notes. Its metrics measured at the performance level and also the runtime contexts which may affect those metrics. It's domain specific configurations and not.
2. What is a part of data - We originally chose the term "part" for our interview because the word dimension is overloaded and leading. However we found that although people's choices of data parts can fit into fairly standard categories, they varied significantly in their granularity and specificity. 
3. Data mental model - We have so much about this but not sure exactly what to write; Something about ensembles and their high dimensionality being particularly unique and frustrating 
4. Dropping Dimensions - This was the original purpose of this research. To identify where and when people were dropping dimensions when thinking about the data and communicating what charts would be useful for visualizing the data. This is kind of a sub bullet point under data mental model but, the mental model itself doesn't fit a narrative.

Outside of observations we need clear proscriptive advice to readers. Some which may be useful to recall:
1. Consider interviewing software developers and users alike to uncover biases, gaps and assumptions about data when developing a complex data tool. Newer developers may not have any biases and may not need to understand the data in detail. This can cause problems however (see example of P1-P3 and new changes to Thicket maybe idunno)
2.

Possible Research Questions:

From Kate:
-   What factors lead to remembering dimensions/aspects of the data?
-   What elements of a data mental model are there, perhaps those we don't typically think of as part of data typologies? (e.g., causality between parts of the data)
	-   Related: How do people connect multi-typology data?
-   How do people summarize big datasets for communication of shape?

Connor:
-  Can user's understanding of the data be aided by a HUD or some other means of continually communicating the state/shape of data as its transformed?
	- Possibly in a jupyter notebook or other IDE . . .

From Katy:
-  Does this research relate to dimensionality reduction or can it inform DR practices in the HPC space?
